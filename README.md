# WebScrapping

As a project, we had built up a Quiz Game with lifelines and voice support. This Quiz Game supported numerous types of Genre that the user can attempt and earn a "master title" in that Genre. For this kind of game a large dataset of questions was needed and manually creating such a large excel was a tedious task.

Web Scrapping was used to fetch Questions, Options and the correct answers from the websites for different Genre and an excel was created for the same.
